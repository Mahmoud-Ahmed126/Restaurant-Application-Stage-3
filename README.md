Project Overview:
For the Restaurant Reviews project, I convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

I am take a static design that lacks accessibility and I convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

The website retrieves data about restaurants from a server.

The restaurant's data contain rating information about restaurants.

The data main structure and images of the website is persisted in cache using a service worker and the restaurant information/list is stored in indexedDB to achieve a good Offline first experience. Furthermore, the design is responsive, to adjust properly in most/all screen displays. And finally, optimizations have been done based on results from lighthouse to ensure high score of accessibility, Optimization and Progressive Web App.

you can do the following in this project :-
you can filter some resturants according to some features
see the review each restaurant
see the address of the resturant
see the Work schedule in the restaurant weekly
if you are blind no problem, you can access the website via google chrome extention chromeVox

Service-Worker to make the website work offline
Aria roles to get the website accessabile to blind people
Google map application to mark all needed restaurants on it
Indexed DataBase to store date retrived from the server
